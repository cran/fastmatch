 NEWS for fastmatch

    o	match() coerces POSIXlt objects into characters, but so far 
	fmatch() performed the match on the actual objects.
	Now fmatch() coerces POSIXlt object into characters just like
	match(), but note that you will lose the ability to perform
	fast lookups if the table is a POSIXlt object -- please use
	POSIXct objects (much more efficient) or use as.character() on
	the POSIXlt object to create a table that you want to re-use.
